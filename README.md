# Chia Network Scanner

Performs an asyncronous scan of the Chia network.

Rather than implementing a full node it communicates with another full node and requests it's peers - from there a graph traversal of the network is performed.

This powers the node count charts of [Chia Explorer](https://www.chiaexplorer.com).

## Usage

This can be installed as a module using npm:

```bash
npm install chia-network-scanner
```

Here is an example of how to scan the Chia Network:

```javascript
import { ChiaNetworkScanner } from 'chia-network-scanner';

const chiaNetworkScanner = new ChiaNetworkScanner({
    // The network to scan and protocol to use
    network: {
        networkId: 'd4735eaa2ffe1cceeeef59718b9eed0ee19cc7d8bbc51ff0da226611ec44a555',
        protocolVersion: '0.0.29',
        softwareVersion: '0.2.2'
    },

    startNodes: [{
        hostname: 'introducer.scampool.org',
        port: 8444,
    }],

    // Identifies this peer on the network
    peer: {
        nodeType: 1,
    },

    // Used to timeout on various operations such as handshake
    connectionTimeout: 2500,

    // Number of peers to scan concurrently. Bigger is faster but uses more sockets and memory :)
    concurrency: 50,

    // Full node public key
    keyPath: '/root/123.key',

    // Full node public cert
    certPath: '/root/123.crt'
});

const peers = await chiaNetworkScanner.scan();
```

The result of the scan is an array of peer objects that have a `hostname`, `port` and `timestamp`.

## Logs

You will see lots of logs about connections refused and not handling messages that other peers have sent to you. This is fine. Example:
